1. main3.py is the driver for the 3D Gaussian process based surface fitting. 
   You need to provide the input as a *.mrc file where each object are labeled by 
   an unique integer (>0ï¼Œ0 is for the background). The code will go through each object 
   one by one. It will produce 'mean_mat' which contains the mean of Gaussian distribution 
   at each voxel. (Stored in pickle format, which can be read and written with the pickle package ).

2. Lines 181-- 230 in main3.py contain the code for generating the anchor point, which a user
   may modify to adapt to his/her object. For the test membrane structures used for the publication, 
   randomly generated anchor points on the surface of an ellipsoid are used as the outer anchor points.
   The inner anchor point may be chosen as the centroid to the points to be fitted.

3  The show.py code can be used to  write the final results as a 'mean_mat' file. 
   A user need to specify the surface rendering threshold on line 42.

4. A user needs to install the package 'mrcfile' with 'pip install mrcfile'.
