1.main3D.m is the driver. A user needs to specify the name of the input *.mrc file (that stores
preprocessed tomogram slices) in the code.  Each slice in the input *.mrc volume file should 
contain a zero or non-zero object index label for each pixel.  Zero is used to represent the background 
and a nonzero integer i indicates that the pixel belongs to the i-th object.  
The code will merge all neighbouring object pixels (In 26 directions([0,1,-1],[0,1,-1],[0,1,-1])\[0,0,0])) and writeout the merged volume to an output file. 

2.The code will output the '*_3D.mrc' file where all object regions are labeled by 100 and output the '*_3D_color.mrc' file where all object regions are labeled by object index i.

3.The code will output the first 10 regions with the most pixels. You can change the code in line 97 and line 112 to change the number of regions.

4.EMIODist2 is the package for  reading and outputing the mrc files.
